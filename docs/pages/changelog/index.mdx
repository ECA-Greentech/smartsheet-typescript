# Release Notes

<Callout type="warning">
  This SDK will be in early access (unstable) until bumping to v1.0.0 when it's ready for general availability and production use.
  During early access, it is possible to have breaking major changes without bumping the major version number in SemVer,
  but we will post an upgrade guide in the release notes for every breaking change.
</Callout>



## 0.1.1

* Fixed a bug where `loadSheet` might not check through all available sheets due to default pagination.

## 0.1.0

* Added `strict` option to `loadSheet` for strictly enforcing the schema of the sheet (disabling backwards compatibility).
* Added `loadSheetByPermalink` for loading a sheet by its permalink. This mode does not create sheet when it does not exist.
* Added the access of `listSheets` and `api` directly from prepared SDK object for better developer experience.
* Fixed some minor bugs introduced in previous early access versions.

## 0.0.3

* Added system column type support.

## 0.0.2

* Added full format support including color, font size, number format, currency, thousands separator, and more.

## 0.0.1

* Initial launch of the SDK for early access.
