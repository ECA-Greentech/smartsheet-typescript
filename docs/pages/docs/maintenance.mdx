# Development and Maintenance

The Smartsheet SDK for TypeScript is created and currently maintained by ECA Solar LLC.
We are not affiliated with Smartsheet Inc. in any way. As of now, this SDK is in a very early stage of development.
We (ECA Solar LLC) are using it in our own projects, but it is not yet ready for general production usage.
We are working on it, though, and we hope to have a stable release soon.

If you are having trouble with the SDK, please open an issue on GitHub.
We (ECA Solar LLC) will do our best to help you out, but we cannot guarantee a response time or a solution.

If you would like to contribute to the SDK, please open a pull request on GitHub.
If you are trying to redesign the SDK that our team does not agree with, you can fork the repository and make your own changes.
All contributions and further modifications are welcome.
